You can divide your API description into several separate files using the OpenAPIGroup annotation.
With this annotation, you can specify one or more groups that this endpoint will be included in,
as well as specify groups from which this endpoint should be excluded. You can annotate method, class or package (subpackages not included!).

For example, you have a controller like this:

[source,java]
----
@Controller
public class ApiController {

    @OpenAPIGroup(exclude = "v2")
    @Get("/read/{id}")
    public String read(String id) {
        return "OK!";
    }

    @OpenAPIGroup("v2")
    @Post("/save/{id}")
    public String save2(String id, Object body) {
        return "OK!";
    }

    @OpenAPIGroup({"v1", "v2"})
    @Post("/save")
    public String save(Object body) {
        return "OK!";
    }
}
----

After processing, you will have 2 different swagger files. The first file for group *v1*
contain the description of the endpoints `/save` and `/read/{id}`. The second one will contain
the description of the endpoints `/save` and `/save/{id}`.
