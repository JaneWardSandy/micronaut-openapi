The annotation can be used to add suffix and prefix for operationIds.
This solves the problem when you have several different controllers, but with same operation names.

For example, when you have 2 controllers with same operations, but use generics:
[source,java]
----
@OpenAPIDecorator(opIdPrefix = "cats-", opIdSuffix = "-suffix")
@Controller("/cats")
interface MyCatsOperations extends Api<MyRequest, MyResponse> {
}

@OpenAPIDecorator("dogs-")
@Controller("/dogs")
interface MyDogsOperations extends Api<MyRequest, MyResponse> {
}
----
