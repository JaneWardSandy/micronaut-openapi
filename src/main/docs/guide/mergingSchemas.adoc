Often times you might want to generate OpenAPI (Swagger) YAML for built-in endpoints or paths from some other modules, such as `security`. In order to generate YAML including all that information, Micronaut supports merging of multiple OpenAPI YAML files. So, you can create OpenAPI YAML files manually at some predefined path from where the information will then be merged into the final YAML file.

For example, if you are using https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html#openid[Micronaut's Security OpenID Connect] with https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/[Amazon Cognito] your application exposes several endpoints which you could define in an external OpenAPI YAML file such as:

[source,yaml]
.openapi/oauth.yml
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: OAuth
  description: Endpoints related to the integration with Amazon Cognito
  version: "1.0"
paths:
  /logout:
    get:
      tags:
      - security
      description: deletes the JWT cookie and redirects to /oauth/login/cognito
      operationId: logout
      responses:
        200:
          description: logout 200 response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:

  /oauth/callback/cognito:
    get:
      tags:
      - security
      description: receives a callback from the authorization server with a code to

      operationId: oauth-callback-cognito
      parameters:
      - name: authorizationResponse
        in: query
        required: true
        explode: true
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/AuthorizationResponse'
      responses:
        303:
          description: redirects to home page upon successful completion of the authorization
            code grant flow
          headers:
            Set-Cookie:
              description: Cookied named JWT with the id token obtained from the authorization
                server as the value
              schema:
                type: string
  /oauth/login/cognito:
    get:
      tags:
      - security
      description: redirects to authorization server sign in page
      externalDocs:

      operationId: oauth-login-cognito
      responses:
        302:
          description: redirects to authorization server sign in page
  /oauth/logout:
    get:
      tags:
      - security
      description: ends the session in the authorization server and the redirects
        to /logout

          links:
            logout:
              operationId: logout
components:
  schemas:
    AuthorizationResponse:
      required:
      - code
      - state
      type: object
      properties:
        code:
          type: string

        nonce:

          nullable: true
        state:
          type: string
    Object:
      type: object
----

You could also have a yaml file describing the endpoint which exposes the generated OpenAPI YAML file:

[source,yaml]
.openapi/swagger.yml
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: swagger
  version: "1.0"
paths:
  /swagger/demo-0.0.yml:
    get:
      tags:
        - openapi
      description: returns the OpenAPI YAML file describing the API
      operationId: swagger
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OpenAPI YAML file describing the API
          content:
            text/plain: {}
----

To merge both files with the generated OpenAPI definition point, Micronaut searches for additional OpenAPI yaml files in the `openapi` folder, which is specified by `micronaut.openapi.additional.files`.

.openapi.properties
[source,properties]
----
micronaut.openapi.additional.files=openapi
----

Micronaut includes the endpoints defined in those files in the generated output.
